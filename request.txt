The online Playing Platform exposes players scores over time.
It can provide you with data at the following url : http://cdn.55labs.com/demo/api.json

The objective is to build a good looking HTML page which will query the service and display :
- a bar chart comparing the scores of the players over time
- clicking on a specific bar should populate a detail div and display aggregated numbers
- not required but a plus : update url on details view, and enable direct url access 

Constraints : a lightweight solution is expected and no charting library or JavaScript framework should be used for this test.
